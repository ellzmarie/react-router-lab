## Stock tracking app 

The application will use hard-coded stocks data.
My stock tracking app should have the following features...


# Navigation
No matter what route the user is visiting, they should always see a navigation bar at the top of the window.

It should contain links to "Home" and "About" pages.

# Dashboard (/stocks)
If a user visits /stocksor clicks "Home" in the navigation bar, they should be directed to a dashboard page. This page should list all of the stocks that the user is tracking, specifically their nameand symbol. These stocks should be pulled from stock-data.js.

Bonus: Try rendering the stocks as per the image below.

# Stock (/stocks/:symbol)
If a user clicks on one of the stocks listed in the Dashboard view, they should be directed to an individual stock show view. This view should display all of a stock's attributes.

The resources listed at the bottom of the readme might come in handy when building this out.

# About (/about)
If a user clicks on "About" in the navigation bar, they should be directed to an about page. This is just a static page that displays a description of your app.
